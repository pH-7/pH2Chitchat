# pH2Chitchat - Real-time Node.js Chat

**pH2Chitchat** is the simplest real-time instantaneous chat using node.js and socket.io (without database, just instantaneous :smiley:).

You can test it easily by using two or more web browsers (or using the incognito mode) and then stimulating as many users as you need.


## Usage
Just run `app.js` with **node.js** (`$ node app.js`).


## Requirement

**Node.js** installed (version 6 would be the best..)
